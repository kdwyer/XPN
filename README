What is it?
 XPN is a simple newsreader written in python using the Gtk+ toolkit for the GUI.

 XPN has a good support for MIME standards (but it has a partial support for 
 multipart articles), so please use it carefully and on text-only newsgroups.
 However XPN is fully unicode compliant.

Requirements:

 - Python (2.5 or better)
 - PyGtk (2.8 or better)
 - GTK+ (2.8 or better)

Read "xpn.html" for more informations.
